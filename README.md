## Project Updates
### Hangman Game (Michael)
* Began creating UI, working to implement MVC once individual pair share calculator complete

### Notepad (Dominic)
* Main UI has been finished
* File menu bar has been added
* Added the following buttons (functionality has been added as well): open, save, and save as
* Indicator to tell if a file has been edited (asterik next to the file's name on the window title)
### Unit Converter (Jason)
* Started framework for the code, not much progress this week
* Created a mental plan/list for what needs to be done
* Frickin key listener is broken
* more research needed in trying to create operations(if I have 6 different units, the code becomes a mess)
